            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>SAynte Paule out of priſon wrote this Epiſtle to theſe Epheſians / whom he fyrſte ſaluteth with a chriſtiane ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacyon / and after the ſalutacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſheweth the cauſes wherfore he wrote this Epiſtle Saynte Paule in his Epyſtles vſeth one chriſtiane ſalutacyon of the whiche we chriſtians may learne howe we ſhulde one ſalute and grete another / And what thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we oughte one to deſyre and wyſhe to another. In this ſalutacion is wryten the name of him that wryteth the Epyſtle / &amp; the name of them to whom it was wryte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the begynnyng ſaynte Paule ſetteth his owne name that they myght knowe this Epyſtle to be wryten of Paule / that
<pb facs="tcp:4756:9"/>
this Epyſtle myghte be better loued and more eſtemed amonges the Epheſyans / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhulde knowe the apoſtle Paule to haue wryten this Epiſtle to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whom they knewe ſurely wolde wryte no thyng to them but that ſhulde be bothe for theyr comfort and profyte of theyr ſoules / &amp; alſo to the glory of god. What man was ſaynt Paule before he was conuerted and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the faythe of Chriſte Ieſu / it is wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten in the Actes of the apoſtles .9. 22. and Philip. 3. Where it is euident that he was a perſecuter of Chriſtes churche / but of a perſecutour god made him to be a defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der and a ſure pyller of Chriſtꝭ goſpel. Which thynge god wrought nat for the merytes of Paule / but of his mere mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes / that we ſhulde diſpayre of no man / as longe as he lyueth / but god may call hym agayne to his grace and fauour and of an euyll man may make him a good man / as he made Paule of a perſecutour of Chriſtꝭ churche a faythfull preacher and a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the goſpell of Chriſte that we ſhulde gloryfy god. Whiche maketh good men of the euyl / and faythful preachers of Chriſtꝭ goſpel of perſecuters. Example in Paule. But if ſynners wyll be made good men of euyll men they muſte folowe Paule / they

And to be redy to do the wyll of god / what his pleaſure is / without al fear of loſſe of goodꝭ of the worlde / of honours or dignities / or of this preſent lyfe / after the example of Paule actes .9. And ſo to walke al our lyfe tyme to goddes pleaſure in our callynge .2. An apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſte. Paule was an Apoſtle nat of men: but of Chriſte Ieſus / he was ſente nat to be a man pleaſer but to pleaſe god / of whom he was ſent nat to pleaſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / but god / to preache the wyll and pleaſure of god and nat of man / excepte the wyll of man be accordyng to the wyl of god. And as he was ſent of god to preache his wyll and pleaſure and nat the pleaſure of man / nor to ſynge to men Placebo and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion ſo he dyd / he preached goddes wyll boldly without all feare with muche ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enuy of men of thys worlde and with muche perſecucyon and affliction / as
<pb facs="tcp:4756:10"/>
it appereth thoroughout the actes of the apoſtles .3. in that Paule was an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Apoſtolus is a Greke worde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokenyth one that is ſent furth of another to do a meſſage. So Paule dyd nat ſende him ſelfe to preache the goſpell of Chriſte / but he was ſent of god &amp; appointed to that offyce by Ananias / as is wryten in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes .9. ſo it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myth other to be called of god and by man that ſhalbe preachers. There is .iiii. maners of apoſtles as ſaynt Hierome ſheweth Gala .1. Fyrſte be they whiche be ſende of god only / as the prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes were. Secondly be they which be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of god &amp; ſende alſo by man. As Paule / Titus / &amp; Timotheꝰ was. Thirdly be they whiche be nat called of god but ſende by man by fauour / loue / money / ſeruyce / fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and ſuche lyke. Fourthly be they whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che be nother called of god nor of man / but they thruſte them ſelues in that comon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce ſekyng theyr owne auantage / lucre / profyte / glory / eaſe / reſte / and ſuche lyke.</p>
               <p>In this place ſaynte Paule reproueth all them that wyll take on hande this comon offyce as to be the miniſter of god / and to be his legate / whiche be nat called of god to that offyce whiche ſeke rather the glory of men and theyr owne lucre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glory
<pb facs="tcp:4756:10"/>
of god or the profyte of theyr neyghbour, what maner of men they ſhulde be / and what qualites they ſhulde haue that ſhulde be byſhoppes ſaynte Paule declareth. 1. Timo. 3. ad Titu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. men well lerned in the ſcriptures of god / able for to teache hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctryne / and by the ſame to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all them that wyll ſpeake agaynſte the truthe. Titu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. men that be ſober / ſad / &amp; deſcrete that ſeke onely the glory of god / &amp; the ſaluacyon of other. Therfore it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euery man to tary hys vocacion be he neuer ſo well learned / leaſte he for hys haſtynes renne into dampnacyon / takyng vpon him and vſurpyng a comen power before he be called to it by the ſuperior po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to whom the vocacion as touchynge the outwarde vocacyon belongeth. And if it be ſo that the hye powers i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this behalfe be necligente to ſeke for true miniſters of goddes worde / &amp; wolde nat haue faythfull preachers of the goſpell / or care nat for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or care n t whether the people be fed with gods worde or no.

ſaluacyon / may &amp; ought to offer hym ſelfe to the hye powers and deſyre theyr au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thorite and lycence to preache the goſpell / as ſaynte Paule ſayth .1. Timo. 3. He that deſyreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offyce of a biſhop he deſyreth an honeſt labour. If the ſuperior powers wyl nat gyue hym lycence in whom they fynde no faute / then may he whiche is called of god / walke in his callynge / &amp; do the offyce that he is called to of god / for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to obey god then man. Act. 4. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wolde no man of his priuate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſhulde take vpon hym this hye offyce of god / as to preache his worde openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be called of god and by man / or at the leaſte of god / and attempted by lawful meanes the vocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man / ſhewyng him ſelfe alway obediente to the laufull cyuill ordinaunces. 4. The Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt / Paule was the apoſtle nat of man but of Ieſus Chriſte to preache Chriſtes wyll and pleaſure / and nat to pleaſe hym ſelfe or to be a man pleaſer / nor to preache mennes phantaſies and dreames / ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes inuencion or mannes doctrines. And here in theſe wordes he reproueth all pſeudo apoſtles whiche ſtudy more to pleaſe men then God / whiche preache nat Goddes worde puerly and ſincerly / but myxyng it
<pb facs="tcp:4756:11"/>
with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes fantaſies and dreames ſeking lucre / honour / &amp; profyte of men / all ſuch S. Paule in theſe wordes reproueth and wyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth theym onely to be the meſſengers of Chriſte Ieſus and to ſeke his wyll &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure only. 5. By the wyll of god / here he ſheweth howe he was made the apoſtle of Chriſte / nat by hys wyll nor yet by the wyll of men / or for fauour of any man / but by the wyll of god onely. Of theſe wordes two thynges we maye learne. Firſte that ſynners do repente and leaue theyr ſynful lyfe / nat of them ſelfe by theyr free wyll / but by the grace and wyll of god / example here in Paule / that ſynners ſhulde gyue al laude and prayſe to God only / for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourninge from ſynne / to vertue / and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge to them ſelues. The ſeconde that we ſhulde knowe trewe and faithful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers / as Paule was to come to vs onely by the wyll of God / and nat of man / or by the prouiſyon of man / althoughe mannes dilygence as muche as may be in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe is to be requyred / whiche thinge yf ſome men wolde conſyder / and with them ſelfe deapely waye the matter / that trewe preachers come by the wyll of God / and nat of man / and whan it pleaſeth god / and nat whan man wylleth / they wolde nat
<pb facs="tcp:4756:12"/>
merueyle why God ſendes nowe in oure tyme more trewer preachers of the goſpel than in our fathers tyme / to whome the truthe was nat ſo puerly &amp; ſyncerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as nowe to vs in our daies by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of god of whome it commeth and nat of our merytes or deſeruynges / or at the wyll of man / to god we ſhulde gyue than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for his truth ſhewed to vs more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it was to our fathers / &amp; to except it with all gladnes / &amp; to folowe the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of Chryſt / &amp; expreſſe it in our lyuyng nothynge meruaylynge that goddes wyll ſhewed .6.
